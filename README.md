<!-- 📌 About Me -->
## 📌 About Me

I’m focused on developing and leading new projects that drive operational efficiency by integrating AI into processes, as well as information security, cryptography, and DevOps best practices.

- 🤖 **AI & Automation:** Building intelligent workflows and prototypes.  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity & Cryptography:** Designing secure systems (COSE, TLS, PKI).  
- ⚙️ **DevOps & Infra:** CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform & Linux/Windows Admin.  

Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, innovate, and continuously improve.  
I’m always eager to connect, share ideas, and explore what the limits of technological innovation truly are.
